*What is this?*
        * Text-based (with possible scenery images) sims-like sandbox game.  More "let it run and watch" than "build stuff".  Like an ant-farm?

*Current Task:*
        * Create a "State" stack (a la the Amethyst game engine) and figure out where that abstraction fits in the overall application design.

*Future Tasks:
        * Add a 3d window running parallel to the terminal
        * Add simple beep noises
        * Create a simple game + ui mockup where one can actually give commands and do simple things like moving between two places.
        * Ability to save and load game data
        * Ensure cross platform (windows and mac) compatibility
