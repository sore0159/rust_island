*What is this?*
        * Text-based (with possible scenery images) sims-like sandbox game.  More "let it run and watch" than "build stuff".  Like an ant-farm?

*Current Task:*
        * Create a two-state mockup system where you hit a button to go to 'main menu' which lets you select quit or resume.

*Future Tasks:*
        * Add a 3d window running parallel to the terminal
        * Add simple beep noises
        * Create a simple game + ui mockup where one can actually give commands and do simple things like moving between two places.
        * Ability to save and load game data
        * Ensure cross platform (windows and mac) compatibility
