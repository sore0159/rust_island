_What is this?_
        * Text-based (with possible scenery images) sims-like sandbox game.  More "let it run and watch" than "build stuff".  Like an ant-farm?

_Current Task:_
        * Add a 3d window running parallel to the terminal

_Future Tasks:_
        * Ability to save and load game data
        * Create a simple game + ui mockup where one can actually give commands and do simple things like moving between two places.
        * Ensure cross platform (windows and mac) compatibility
        * Add simple beep noises
